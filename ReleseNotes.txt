-----+-----+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[req]    75               Cmake build script is complete and cleaned (inlcuding support C++0x, uuid for Unices and alike, support for Boost & blpapi.)
[fix]    77 tick42blp:    Converting the project to be cross platform. Moving non-platform dependant parts from stdafx.h to common.h. stdafx.h is implicitly #included in Windows builds.
[fix]       tick42blp:    Post Build support the use of $(ProjectDir) as parameter %3 for UpdateLibs.cmd and UpdateLibsRelease.cmd instead of using relative path.
[fix]    60 tick42blp:    Subscribe when session is not started throws exception. Status is returned on unseccesfull subscription along with an appropriete log
[fix]    71 tick42blp:    [Need further test with Linux] Improve handling of field mapping file location. When the fieldmap.csv comes without a path (relative) the system try to 
                          look for it in current directory if not found then it looks for it in the WOMBAT_PATH
[req]       tick42blp:    Source code dodumentation for the added features and fixes.
[req]       tick42blp:    tick42blp.vcxproj.user if removed from source control and the debug options became default for the project and they use only
                          mamalistenc as default debug process to work with. That make it easy to debug other clients like View42 and leaving some sort 
						  working debug options for other developers.
[fix]    61 tick42blp:    Date Time Conversion Issues. settings the Date, Time and DateTime fields to follow the OpenMAMA convention from Bloomberg convetion
[req]    60 tick42blp:    [Needs more tests] Subscribe when session is not started throws exception. Creating, cleaning and subscribing of sesion is now safe (with try...catch and error results to the calling functions)
[req]       tick42blp:    Add reference count of owner for blpItem
[req]       tick42blp:    Added synchronization between bridge (on close) and Bloomberg (process event). making sure the process event stays valid till the end of the process-event.
[req]       tick42blp:    Added thin wrapper class library to support interlocked integer and semaphore
[fix]    70 tick42blp:    Fix a crash on the project that happens asynchronously once in a while on shutdown
[req]    65 tick42blp:    Add configuration options to control whether fields from the csv file only are included in the dictionary. (see new fields in under the Dictionary section in mama.properties)
[req]    58 tick42blp:    Publish dictionary to Open MAMA
[fix]    63 tick42blpmsg: Use fids in the blp payload implementation
[fix]    68 tick42blpmsg: Correct the implementation of the blp payload field class
[fix]       tick42blp:    moved non-translated-fileds-fid-generator to the right place in code
[fix]       tick42blp:    moved file initialization process of the internal dictionary to the dictionary object. Thus, symplifing the transport intialization.
[fix]    61 tick42blp:    Date Time Conversion Issues - preliminary support for date only type 
[req]       tick42blp:    added support for arbitrary FID (above id 5000) for non-translated fields
[req]       tick42blp:    added support for special type conversion (from dictionary) 
[fix]    57 tick42blp:    extra logs for issues (transport & dictionary load)
[fix]       tick42blp:    (Tom) add sequence number (see fix in code) 
[req]    57 tick42blp:    Build internal representation of data dictionary and field mappings
[req]    55 tick42blp:    Create csv file for Bloomberg to wombat field mappings
[fix]       tick42blp:    each item string is trimmed in BlpItem::ParseFieldList
[fix]       tick42blp:    tokenizer changed to boost library in BlpItem::ParseFieldList
